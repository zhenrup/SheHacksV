'I wrapped mine in flour tortillas and added shredded cabbage and made “tacos”. It was so good, and I garnished it with the red garlic chili sauce that I get at the Asian supermarket. I even forgot the rice, but it didn’t even matter. Quick, easy, and delicious!'

'Your busy weeknight needs this dish. Even your lazy Saturdays will be happy with it. My family devoured this. It’s so simple to make and it is super delicious and full of flavor. Leftovers warm easily, which is great when you’ve got teenage midnight grazers. The first time I made it, I served it over rice. Second time with rice noodles. The next time I make it I’ll take the advice of the other reviewer and serve as tacos with cabbage. Thank you for the awesome recipe.'

"Great, quick recipe that the whole family loved. I would probably cut some of the brown sugar next time and DEFINITELY use low salt soy sauce. I didn't have enough so I used some regular and it was pretty salty. Next time I'm going to try with coconut aminos. I also added some shredded carrots at the end to increase veggie content. Served with steamed rice. This one will go into our rotation!"

"I didn't have sesame oil, so I just used canola oil. I also didn't have crushed red pepper so I sprinkles in some hot chili powder. I substituted the rice for quinoa for the kids and cauliflower rice for adults. This is a new family favorite!"
